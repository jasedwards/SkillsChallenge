1. Is DbContext used in a thread safe manner?

   No, DbContext is not thread-safe.  We can use a separate DbContext instance for each thread.


2. What would be the server side steps to add an ability to input a new Person record?
       1.  Verify the new person details using server side validation 
           ex: name : validate for special chars, total chars length 
           ex: mobile no : check mobile no format
       2. if valid, then we have to insert record to the db, using store procedure
       3. connect application to db using connection string
       4. we will get this connection string in our codebehind file.
       5. And mention store procedure name and send all the values(parameters) to the store procedure.
